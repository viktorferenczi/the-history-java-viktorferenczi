 * READ THIS AFTER TheHistory.java!

 *
 * DO NOT CHANGE THE TESTS (please)!
 * You may put extra logs to be able to differentiate which test case fails and/or simply comment out parts
 * which are not implemented yet if the output is hard to read but make sure you restore everything and run
 * all tests into their original form.
 *
 *
 * Unit Testing in general:
 * You'll learn about unit testing later but some small info:
 * - you can't test every possibility so test some good and bad cases
 * But how to decide what to test?
 * - always test with good values but 1-2 test usually is engough
 * - always test the _corner cases_
 * What are the corner cases?
 * Those are the special cases:
 * - The first and last good input (for ex. if you handle a certain set of numbers as input)
 * - The 'one before the first good' and 'one after the last good' cases
 *
 * Of course that's not all but a glimpse from the world of testing. Now check out the tests and the notes!
